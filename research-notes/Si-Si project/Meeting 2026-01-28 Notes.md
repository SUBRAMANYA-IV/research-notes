- paper should focus on comparing performance of wafer bonded, epitaxially grown and grafted diodes
	- find literature or other papers that demonstrate the performance of wafer bonded and epitaxial. 
	- Specific figures and numbers to look for: 
		- Ideality Factor
		- Current Density 
		- Rectification Ratio
		- Leakage current. 
- **MOTIVATION**: demonstrate that grafting out performs conventional fabrication methods. 
- We have data from previous batches of grafted diodes, can be used for the paper. 
- Talk to frank flack
- Take the data given by sam, and compare them with the figures, data or plots from the afformentioned papers (wafer bonded, epitaxial). 
- Look into wafer bonding. 
- get a rough draft/idea done by 4th, Wednesday.
