- paper mentions that the hetrostructure fabrication should be done using the "100 watt Si Etch" recipe for 65 seconds
	- **Question**: what is the etch rate or the given recipe, and how deep will it cut? 
		- Want to modify the procedure so we use thinner layers for the grafted donor? 
		- Want to introduce a new step to decrease the thickness of both the donor and recipient Silicon substrates?
	- **Answer** 
		- Layer thickness are given, need to double check if the used recipe yields the same thickness via profilometry (pre and post RIE). 
			- substrate is assumed to be heavily doped N-type Silicon
			- Depletion layer will mainly form in the lightly doped, thick N-type
			- Requires a thicker N-si to ensure depletion layer doesn't venture into the substrate?
				- **I.e, breakdown voltage**
			- Trade off between higher series resistance Vs Higher breakdown voltage.
