## Background
- method to precisely deposit angstrom-level layers of materials
- **self limiting**, limited quantities of precursor present on the surface of the substrate means that the process will naturally limit itself, leading to precise control over the quantities deposited.

- done by repeatedly pulsing precursor and co-reactants in a 2 stage cycle. 
	- first stage introduces precursor, which embeds onto the surface of the substrate
	- precursor is purged from the chamber (**NOTE**: how is this done? ozone purge? purge via inert gas?)
	- Co-reactant is introduced to the chamber, reacting with the precursor and leaving the desired material on the surface of the substrate. 
	- second purge removes any reaction byproducts
	- repeat until required amount is deposited. 

#### Aluminum Oxide ALD Recipe 
- **Precursor**: Trimethylaluminum (TMA). 
- **Co-reactant**: Water vapor 
- **Method**: 
	- TMA is added in the first half of the reaction, **reacting with surface hydroxyl groups ($-OH$)**, depositing aluminum and leaving methyl ($-CH_{3}$) groups, producing methane 
	- Excess TMA and byproducts are purge
	- Water vapor is introduced, reacting with the surface methyl groups to remove them and regenerate hydroxyl groups, creating more methane
	- purge, remove excess water and byproducts. 

**Question**: what form of ALD does the lab use? thermanl, remote-plasma or Direct plasma atomic layer deposition? **changes what co-reactant must be used**

#### Hafnium Oxide ALD Recipe 
- **Precursor**: TDMAH
- **Co-reactant**: Water for TALD, oxygen for RPALD or DPALD
