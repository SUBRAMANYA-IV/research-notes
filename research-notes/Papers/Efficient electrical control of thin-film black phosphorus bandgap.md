###### Abstract
- Thin-film 2-D black phosphorus allows for *dynamic* control of its bandgap. 
- however, theory and *photoemission spectroscopy* show that in its **few layer form(?)**, very large electric fields (volts/nm range) are required to effectively tune the bandgap. 
- investigates thickness-dependent bandgap tuning properties in intrinsic black-phosphorus
	- a result of strong inter-layer electronic-state coupling 
- **continuously tune bangap from 300 meV to <50 meV using a displacement field of 1.1 V/nm.
	- 4 nm BP layers were limited to 75 meV of tuning, and shows strong **non-linear** dependence on biasing field. 
		- Due to Strong interlayer electronic-state coupling
	- 10 nm BP layers; field-induced potential difference overcomes the interlayer coupling. 
		- Efficient, continuous tuning of bandgap from 300 meV to 50 meV with external displacement of 1.1 V/nm
##### Conclusions
- used a dual-gate BP transistor for bandgap measurement under a bias-field.
	- sandwiched between 90 nm $SIO_2$ and 24 nm $Al_2O_3$ gate-dielectric
	- top-gate is made from **titanium/platinum** and silicon substrate is used as the back gate (body-biasing?)

- probes 1 and 2 are used to measure conductance without interference from source/drain contacts

- Pink: logarithmic conductance, Grey: Liner conductance. 
	- Note: positive back-gate voltage indicates accumulation of *holes* as charge-carriers, explaining slower/lower conductivity
	- negative back-gate voltage accumulates electrons above the silicon-oxide dielectric, making electrons the majority-charge carrier, hence higher conductivity
- Note how logarithmic plot is **NOT** centered around 0; indicates black phosphorous is slightly p-type?

- Figure shows that for the 4 nm BP sample, conductance-minimum occurs linearly with respect to back-gate voltage and top-gate voltage. 
- [[displacement fields]] generated in both the top-gate and bottom-gate dielectric should be roughly equal at the charge-neutrality point
