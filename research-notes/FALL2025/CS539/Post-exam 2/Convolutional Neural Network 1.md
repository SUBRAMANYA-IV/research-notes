### What is a Convolution neural Network (CNN)?
- neural network that use *convolution* in place of general matrix multiplication in at least one of the layers. 
- technically a **sliding dot product** or **cross correlation**
- **why convolution?**
	- effective method of feature extraction 
	- main purpose of convolutional layers is to extract **data-dependent, nonlinear** features
		- the layer itself is linear (sum of weighted features), but the result is passed through a non-linear function (ReLU, etc)
	- reduces memory usage: the weights of a convolutional filter is shared by the entire activation channel, known as "weight sharing". far less weight compared to fully connected layers. 
		- for example, a 3 x 3 kernel is slid across the **entire** input tensor; doesn't require an entire layer with matching dimensions (hence, weights and biases), making it far cheaper in terms of memory

### Usage
- primarily for image/video/VR (2 dimensions or higher)
- Shapes or sizes of activation tensors are modified *within* a core network to analyze multi-resolution features 
	- i.e,

#### Object Detection
- Uses the principle of R-CNN, or Region-based Convolutional Network
- **How It works**
	1) Given a full input image (RGB, tensor of 3 dimensions)
	2) Extract **region proposals**
		- R-CNN doesn't scan the whole image pixel-by-pixel
		- instead, uses the classical computer vision algorithm **Selective Search** to propose *cadidate bounding boxes* where objects *might* be
		- **NOT GENERATED BY NEURAL NETWORKS**
		- instead fund by low-level features like 
			- color similarity
			- texture similarity
			- region closeness 
			- edge boundaries
		- Selective search will generate ~2000 region proposal per image (yellow boxes in the image)
	3) For each region proposal...
		1) Crop the region (i.e, only analyze pixels inside the bounding box)
		2) warp the cropped image: resize the cropped image so it fits into the CNN (i.e, 224 x 224). 
		3) Run each cropped image through the neural network. the CNN extracts a feature-vector (e.g, a 4096 dim vector)
		4) Classify each region; each regions CNN eature vector is sent to: 
			- an SVM that classifies its object type
			- a regressor that adjusts the bounding box
