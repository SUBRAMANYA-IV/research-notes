#### Essay Draft V.1

My decision to apply to the graduate program of Electrical Engineering, with a focus on microfabrication and nanodevices at UT Dallas has been driven by my overarching goal of pursuing a career in the field of applied research; bringing technology from academia to industry, with the focus on micofabrication being driven by my exposure to the field as an undergraduate researcher at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. My time at the Wisconsin Nano Engineering Device Laboraory, or WISNED,  was my initial introduction to the field of microdevices and fabrication.

**HOOK**
My driving goal is to bring research from academia to the market; not to just publish papers, but to work on methods, techniques and technologies that allow promising but impractical research in academia to be commercialized to drive innovation in industry. I'm inspired by institutions like Bell Labs, the National Labs and Texas instruments, who all exemplified this principle of applied research, pushing the boundary on whats possible. 

**Paragraph 1: Qualifications and work**

This interest in nanofabrication started when I joined the Wisconsin Nano Engineering Device Laboratory during my undergradaute studies at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. 
My work focused on stuff like device characterization, 
- interest in nanofabrication and devices started when I joined WISNED

- list main contributions
	- **NOTE**: dont just list these, write them as a *narrative*
		- sophomore year: hands on fabrication, device grafting
		- Junior year: more fabrication, more advanced (reactive ion etching), data analysis/processing (briefly mention XPS data analysis, come back to later)
		- Senior year: metrology (AFM, XPS, XRD), more advanced data analysis (briefly mention permittivity profile using machine learning principles or something)
	- fabrication work, fabrication devices that were used in the writing of a research paper
	- characterized the devices, IV measurements that was used in papers
	- data analysis/processing
- List independent work (XPS measurement)
	- highlight how this was independently proposed, researched and developed
	- presented at the undergraduate research symposium
- Mention current work on development of permittivity profile software using machine learning principles with gradient-free models
	- independently studied the theory behind band structures
	- researched fitting models like tauc-lorentz, etc for inspiration/understanding
	- because this isn't done yet, mention *intended* impact/goal (allows for use of ellipsometry of unknown alloys, enabling/furthering development?)
- after mentioing these two, highlight my independent nature of whatever:
	- go from see problem-> discuss with others -> independent research-> develop solution 

**Paragraph 2: interdisciplenary aspect**
- Mention how having interdisciplenary experience across the entire semiconductor stack (computer architecture, VLSI work (layout, etc) and materials), and how this is required to be an effective researcher; can effectively address key constraints/bottlenecks int he current industry. 
- Then actually describe works in other areas in the semiconductor stack?
	- Breifly mention RTL work
		- 1 sentence for course work on CPU architecture
		- 3-4 sentences for F-14 CADC, tie it back to how designing it made me realize the brutal constraints engineers had back then, made me realize how applied research has propelled the industry forward...
			- "a...how far applied research from institutions like Bell Labs and Texas Instruments brought us... and how much further we can go"
	- VLSI work: namedrop course? ECE555, work on layout, project of laying out a neuron; massive optimizations, focusing area and timing?
	- software; understanding of low level stuff in the form of C/C++, high level stuff like python used for previous data analysis work. Call back to XPS/permittivity work
**Paragraph 4: goals, why masters, why UT dallas**
- harken back to goal mentioned several times in the essay; goal is to pursue a career in applied research, either in organizations like IMEC, national labs, other research groups, or specifically R&D branches of larger organizations like TSMC, Global Foundries, IBM research, etc. 
- Why UT dallas
	- **CONTENTIOUS**: mention previous member of WISNED, now member at UT dallas as assitant professor. extensively described the incredible research UT dallas does in the semiconductor field, and how dallas has a vibrant ecosystem in all echelons of the field
	- mention UT dallas's history of being founded by TI, and how this exemplifies the idea of applied research. big strides in the field of (insert specifics, inventions), current work in (specifics)
	- Mention how dallas has has a vibrant ecosystem, chain all the way from fabrication to the top, and how me being interdisciplinary in nature draws me to the opportunities there, especially to contribute to research and development work at any of these companies/groups. 
	- name drop UT dallas specifics, research in (x,y,z) etc
		- name drop a few things on your work, how you could meaningfully contribute, etc. 
#### Essay Draft 1
My driving goal is to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications; to create work that extends beyond the literature into tangible impact by developing methods and technologies that allow promising but impractical research in academia to be mass-adopted, and to drive innovation in industry. I'm inspired by institutions like Bell Labs, the National Labs and Texas Instruments, whose legacy of applied research is embodied in UT Dallas.

This commitment to applied research shaped my work from the beginning. At the Wisconsin Nano Engineering Device Laboratory (WISNED), I've spent three years progressing from basic fabrication tasks to working on independent computational projects as a senior, developing both hands-on expertise and theoretical depth.

As a sophomore, I learned our group's grafting technique for lattice-mismatched semiconductor layers, fabricating samples that contributed to heterojunction device research. During my junior year, a pipe rupture in the clean room halted most fabrication work. In spite of this, I discussed data analysis bottle necks with graduate students to continue contributing meaningfully. A pervasive problem was the large variance in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy binding energy measurements; depending on what region of data was selected for linear regression, results could differ significantly, on top of the measured data being noisy. I developed a python-based analysis pipeline using the RANSAC regression and savitzky-golay filter to automatically identify the optimal data subset, which outperformed the groups current methodology. The tool was adopted by several group members and I presented the work at UW's undergraduate research symposium. 

As I entered my senior year, I shifted focus to metrology, learning characterization techniques including atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction and ellipsometry while contributing to a PhD student's research on tunable bandgap Germanium-Tin devices for infrared sensing. 
Working with ellipsometry data, I noticed a recurring challenge; many novel alloy compositions lack well defined permittivity models, making optical characterization difficult. This motivated my current independent project; developing a gradient-free machine learning approach to extract permittivity profiles from ellipsometry measurements. I've researched models like Tauc-lorentz oscillators and critical point analysis to inform the fitting algorithm, with the goal of generating theoretical optical profiles of unknown alloys given a similar material or baseline profile. 

#### Feedback
- HOOK: remove impractical, rework how to convey the idea of "bridging", divide between basic/applied science. 
	- **MASS ADOPTED**: not the correct phrasing, can be reworked. 
	- **REFERENCE TO INSTITUTIONS**: rework to introduce the idea of actually pursuing a career at institutions like these, tie back to the goal of masters
		- remove the word legacy, more specific on **why** UT dallas. 
	- Make it a bit more human, give a personal touch, ease into it a bit more. 
- **Paragraph 1**
	- mention more "internally" what it did; not just what *you* did, or what you contributed, but what it made you feel, realize or what realizations you had. 
	- for the burst-pipe part, rework the "inspite"; instead maybe
		- DONT make it sound like "i still tried contributing to xyz", instead put more emphasis on your contributions instead. 
	- define by what *metric* it "outperformed" originPRO. 
- **Paragraph 2**
	- clarity the "shifted focus" aspect to show that it was more going into what the group *needed* me to do. 
	- grateful or "realized" the vast theory behind it? or something else, about how its a great thing to be doing. 
	- constrast how even if I shifted field, I continued to apply my independent nature to focusing and fixing issues faced by the group. 
	- make it **far** more explicit on how the GeSn work is **applied in nature**; can be applicable first, maybe use the idea of "this made me feel xyz way"
		- How working across multiple people, groups, compnies made me realize/reinforce interest in applied research, as this technology has very real, very useful applications in real life. 
- **OVERALL COMMENTS**
	- emphasize in the paragraphs the tie to *applied* research?
	- OR, rephrase the intro to problem solving a process **and also** the bigger idea of "using my WORK to solve problems". 
	- for the germanium tin, emphasize how the work being done is straddling
	- Maybe be more explicit about how I'm drawn to applied research
	- maybe mention *how* or *why* you got into electrical engineering, which aspects of electrical engineering. 
- **THESIS MASTERS**
	- Highlight your ideas of how YOU being interdisciplanary can help you pursue potential thesis options in the sense of black phospohrous devices, related to both fabrication (materials science) device design (PDK's, layout, mask design, etc).
