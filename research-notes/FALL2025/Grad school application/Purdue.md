- Literally no essay? wtf?
- Didn't mention any letters of recommendation either???
- just mentions which faculty you'd like to work with?
- has a section focused on publications???


- for Purdue, lean more into the novel fields that they research that no other universities really explore
- mention interest in specific fields, how Purdue does *niche* nano fabrication/micro fabrication in groups like xyz, and how I'd be bale to contribute to work at other companies like abc. 
- maybe *don't* mention the goal of PhD'ing in, could give the idea that "i wanted to get into a PhD, but im not good enough". 
- better idea to directly mention the masters. 
- don't be shy of mentioning the goal of applied research, mention how purdue will *still* give you training in work that would help you get into applied research work.
