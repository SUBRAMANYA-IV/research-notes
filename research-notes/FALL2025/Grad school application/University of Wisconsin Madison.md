#### SOP outline
##### Hook
My driving goal is to bring research from academia to the market; not to just publish papers, but to work on methods, techniques and technologies that allow promising but impractical research in academia to be commercialized to drive innovation in industry. I'm inspired by institutions like Bell Labs, the National Labs and Texas instruments, who all exemplified this principle of applied research, pushing the boundary on whats possible. 


##### Paragraph 1: Qualifcations and work
his interest in nanofabrication started when I joined the Wisconsin Nano Engineering Device Laboratory during my undergradaute studies at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. 
My work focused on stuff like device characterization, 
- interest in nanofabrication and devices started when I joined WISNED
- worked mainly in materials science, device fabrication, etc
- list main contributions
	- **NOTE**: dont just list these, write them as a *narrative*

- after mentioing these two, highlight my independent nature of whatever:
	- go from see problem-> discuss with others -> independent research-> develop solution 

##### Paragraph 2: Interdisciplinary aspect
Mention how having interdisciplenary experience across the entire semiconductor stack (computer architecture, VLSI work (layout, etc) and materials), and how this is required to be an effective researcher; can effectively address key constraints/bottlenecks int he current industry. 
- Then actually describe works in other areas in the semiconductor stack?
	- Breifly mention RTL work
		- 1 sentence for course work on CPU architecture
		- 3-4 sentences for F-14 CADC, tie it back to how designing it made me realize the brutal constraints engineers had back then, made me realize how applied research has propelled the industry forward...

#### Paragraph 3: Goals, why masters, why UW madison
- original goal to pursue a career in applied research, either at organizations like IMEC, national labs or research branches of other universities. 
- **WHY UW MADISON**
	- Focus on continuing on current research work at WISNED, highlight how a masters would give me the tools and knowledge to contribute in a much more meaningful way to the group
	- having more autonomy, access to equipment, contribute more meaningfully to the group
	- mention working with other groups as well, now that I have enough theoretical knowledge and experience from my time at WISNED to meaningfully contribute to other groups
		- point to the fact that enrolled in advanced graduate level courses in xyz topic, allows me 
	- **CONTENTIOUS**: mention how one of the biggest hurdles as an undergraduate is that I dont have access to the universities FOM (payment system to access equipment), so wasn't able to independently work without the supervision of post-graduate students. Now that im in a masters, have the ability to propose, work on and pursue independent ideas and projects?
	- For a thesis masters application
		- "a natural direction or my masters thesis would be investigating the photoluminescence properties of tunable bandgap GeSn devices- specifically, how varying tin composition affects optical emission cahrecterisctics and device performance for MWIR applications. This work builds directly on my current role in the project while allowing me to lead experimental design and data interpretation"
		- "Beyond GeSn, I'm also interested in exploring other tunable bandgap materials like black phosphorous, particularly in addressing gaps in electroluminescence charectrization. My experience with mask design and VLSI layout tols like klayout would enable be to fabricate the double-gate structures required for such devices, and UW's collaborative research environment offers opportunities to pursue interdisciplanary projects like this"


When I started at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I knew I was interested in electrical engineering but wasn't sure which direction to take. That changed when I joined the Wisconsin Nano Engineering Device Laboratory as a sophomore. Working in the cleanroom—fabricating samples, troubleshooting processes, seeing research move from concept to reality—I realized what I wanted to do: not just understand how devices work, but build technologies that leave the lab and solve real problems. I'm drawn to applied research, where academic breakthroughs become practical tools. Pursuing a thesis-based master's at UW-Madison is the natural next step, allowing me to deepen my contributions to WISNED and other research groups while building the theoretical foundation and research independence needed to pursue applied research at institutions like IMEC, national labs, or industry R&D.

Since joining WISNED, my work has reflected that commitment. I've progressed from basic fabrication as a sophomore to independent computational projects as a senior, developing both hands-on and theoretical expertise.

As a sophomore, I learned our group's grafting technique for lattice-mismatched semiconductor layers, fabricating samples that contributed to heterojunction device research. During my junior year, a pipe rupture in the clean room halted most fabrication work. In spite of this, I discussed data analysis bottle necks with graduate students to continue contributing meaningfully. A pervasive problem was the large variance in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy binding energy measurements; depending on what region of data was selected for linear regression, results could differ significantly, on top of the measured data being noisy. I developed a python-based analysis pipeline using the RANSAC regression and savitzky-golay filter to automatically identify the optimal data subset, which outperformed the groups current methodology. The tool was adopted by several group members and I presented the work at UW's undergraduate research symposium. This project taught me an important lesson about research: there's often a significant gap between theoretical parameters and actual equipment performance. I'm seeing this firsthand now—our reactive ion etcher recently came back online, and I've been tasked with re-calibrating it over winter break. We'll spend weeks running test recipes on dummy wafers to establish baseline etch rates, even though the theoretical values are well-documented. My XPS work prepared me for this kind of pragmatic problem-solving: building solutions that work with real-world conditions, not idealized assumptions.

As I entered my senior year, the group's priorities shifted toward optical characterization for a new project: tuneable bandgap Germanium Tin devices for mid-wave infrared sensing. I moved into metrology work, learning techniques like atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction and ellipsometry. the theoretical depth behind these tools - understanding band structures, frequency-dependent optical properties and critical point analysis- was far more extensive than i'd anticipated, and I found myself drawn into the physics that makes characterization possible. 

This project also exposed me to real applied research for the first time. The work involved collaboration across multiple universities and industry partners, with the explicit goal of developing practical infrared imaging technology using Germanium-Tin alloys. Seeing research progress with real deployment timelines and real-world applications reinforced my goal to work in applied research, where timelines and real-world constraints shape the work. 

Working with ellisometry measurements, we came across a recurring bottleneck; novel alloy compositions often lack well defined permittivity models, making optical characterization difficult or impossible. This motivated my current independent project; developing a gradient free machine learning approach to extract permittivity profiles directly from ellipsometry measurements. I've research parametric models like Tuac-Lorentz oscillators and critical point analysis to inform the fitting algorithm, with the goal of enabling characterization of arbitrary alloy compositions without requiring prior optical constants. 

While working with my graduate mentor on ellipsometry measurements of Germanium-Tin samples, we encountered a challenge: novel alloy compositions often lack well-defined permittivity models. I found a paper describing linear relationships between optical constants and tin composition in amorphous GeSn, which could feed into the Tauc-Lorentz model. I implemented this in C++ and tested it against a known crystalline GeSn sample—it matched remarkably well. If this worked across compositions, it could enable characterization of arbitrary GeSn alloys without fabricating dozens of incremental samples. Then I realized: the paper's data was for amorphous GeSn. Crystalline structures have fundamentally different physics.
I kept researching, looking for approaches that could handle crystalline band structures. the more I dug into the theory, the more overwhelming it seemed; there's no single equation for crystalline optical properties, just layers upon layers of complex physics. Then I cam across critical point analysis, which describes optical response as the sum of oscillators that could be aggregated around the critical points of the band structure, which were well documented. This offered a path forward. 

I'm now developing a gradient-free machine learning approach to fit combinations of these oscillators to experimental ellipsometry data, with the goal of enabling optical characterization of arbitrary crystalline alloys without requiring prior permittivity models—removing a significant barrier in exploratory materials research.

Continuing at UW-Madison for a master's thesis is the natural next step. The university's extensive facilities, research capabilities, and my established connections within WISNED position me to pursue ambitious thesis work while exploring collaborations across groups.

A natural direction for my thesis would be investigating photoluminescence properties of tunable bandgap Germanium-Tin devices—specifically, how our novel grafting fabrication method compares to classical epitaxial growth, and how varying tin composition affects optical emission for mid-wave infrared applications. This builds directly on my current metrology work and aligns with the group's ongoing priorities.
Beyond GeSn, I'm also interested in exploring other tunable bandgap materials like black phosphorus, driven in part by my ongoing interview process at IMEC for a position focusing on dynamically-tunable bandgaps in double-gated black phosphorus devices. My interdisciplinary background—which has enabled me to build computational tools for characterization challenges—extends to mask design and GDS layout (KLayout), device fabrication, and optical characterization. This would allow me to contribute across the full device development pipeline, from designing double-gate structures to characterizing emission properties. UW's 2D materials research group could provide expertise and resources for this work, complementing WISNED's optical characterization capabilities and making this kind of interdisciplinary project feasible.

As a sophomore, I spent time gaining hands on experience with our group's grafting technique for lattice-mismatched semiconductor layers, fabricating samples that contributed to heterojunction device research. During my junior year, a pipe rupture in the clean room halted most fabrication work. I looked for other ways to contribute and discussed data analysis bottlenecks with graduate students. A pervasive problem was the large variance in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy binding energy measurements; depending on what region of data was selected for linear regression, results could differ significantly, on top of the measured data being noisy. I developed a Python-based analysis pipeline using the RANSAC regression and Savitzky-Golay filter to automatically identify the optimal data subset, which produced more consistent binding energy measurements with reduced operator-dependent variance compared to the group's existing approach. The tool was adopted by several group members, and I presented the work at UW's undergraduate research symposium. This project taught me an important lesson about research: there's often a significant gap between theoretical parameters and actual equipment performance. I'm seeing this firsthand now. Our reactive ion etcher recently came back online, and I've been tasked with recalibrating it over winter break.

The work i've done at WISNED reflects where I want to take my career: applied research at institutions like IMEC, national labs or semiconductor R&D groups, l of which focus on moving technologies from proof-of-concept to production. I'm drawn to roles involving process improvements, device optimization and characterization work that directly impacts whether technologies can be manufactured. 

A natural direction for my thesis would be investigating photoluminescence properties of tunable bandgap Germanium-Tin devices, specifically, how our novel grafting fabrication method compares to classical epitaxial growth, and how varying tin composition affects optical emission for mid-wave infrared applications. This builds directly on my current metrology work and aligns with the group's ongoing priorities.

UW's 2D materials research group could provide expertise and resources for this work, complementing WISNED's optical characterization capabilities and making this kind of interdisciplinary project feasible. A master's thesis at UW provides both the resources and flexibility to pursue these directions while building toward my applied research goals. 

UW-Madison's research culture gave me opportunities I didn't anticipate as an undergraduate; access to clean rooms, mentorship from graduate students and the chance to pursue independent projects. Continuing for a master's thesis would allow me to build on that foundation, developing the independence and depth needed to pursue applied research.
