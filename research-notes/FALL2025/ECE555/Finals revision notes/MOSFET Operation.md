- NPN Junction is given by the following diagram
![[Pasted image 20251215022255.png]]
- at zero gate bias, high potential barrier between N and P regions 
- potential barrier formed due to P-N junction thats formed between the N wells and P substrate

- Applying a forward bias between source and gate leads to lowering of barrier potential
- applying forward bias between source and **drain** leads to lowering of potential further 

#### Cutoff, Linear and Saturation 
- Recall that cutoff occurs whenever the source-gate voltage is **lower** than the threshold voltage
- the linear region is defined as 
	- Gate voltage is **above** the threshold voltage
	- **source drain voltage** is between 0 and the effective gate voltage
