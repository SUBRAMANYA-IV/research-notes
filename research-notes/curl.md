- Curl, represented by $\vec{\nabla}$ is an operator hich describes the **infinitesimal circulation** of a vector field in three dimensional space. 
- Related to the right hand rule when describing the magnetic field generated by a flow of current through a conducting wire.

- in this example, given the strength of the magnetic field, the curl of the magnetic field yield the strength of the current (or some value that's proportional to it?)
- a curl in three dimensions is given by the following 
$$
\vec{\nabla} \times   \vec{F} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\
\frac{d}{dx} & \frac{d}{dy} & \frac{d}{dz} \\
F_{x} & F_{y} & F_{Z}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
- Intuitively, take the example of the z-component of the curl, which is a result of the cross product between the x and y component. 
	- For the "differential" aspect, take a tiny rectangle in the xy-plane. 
	- Only two field components here matter: 
		- $F_{x}$ along the horizontal edge
		- $F_{y}$ along vertical edges.
