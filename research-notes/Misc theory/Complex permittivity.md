## What
- describes energy/wavelength/frequency dependent permittivity of a material
- composed of real and imaginary component
	- real component corresponds to a materials ability to store electrical energy 
	- imaginary part corresponds to a materials ability to dissipate electrical energy as heat when subject to an electric field

## Why
- models the [[complex refractive index]] of a material
- used in ellipsometry to characterize the materials ideal/expected behavior for various thicknesses
## How
- Via various dispersion models, such as 
	- [[tauc-lorentz]]
	- [[forouhi-bloomer]]
	- [[brendel-bormann]]
- Yields the complex-permittivity as a function of the electromagnetic waves energy (directly related to eV, wavelength and frequency)
- Related to [[Electric susceptibility]] via the formula
$$
\vec{P}=\epsilon_{0}\chi_{e}\vec{E}
$$
- where $\vec{P}$ is the polarization density
$$
\chi_{e}=\epsilon_{r}-1
$$
- the above equation relates the relative permittivity of the material $e_{r}$ and its susceptibility $\chi_{e}$
