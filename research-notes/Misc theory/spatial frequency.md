#### spatial frequency
- reciprocal of the wavelength, ie angular wave number $k$ can be given by 
$$k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$$
- given the wavelength $\lambda$ is "distance per complete cycle", spatial frequency $\xi$  yields "cycle per unit distance"
	- Can be thought of "how much of a cycle is complete per unit distance"
	- larger $\xi$ value means the wave oscillates more rapidly *in space*
