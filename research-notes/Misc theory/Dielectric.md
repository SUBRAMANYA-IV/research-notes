## What
- material that is an *insulator*, but accumulates an electric dipole in the presence of an electric field
- becomes **polarized** in the presence of an electric field
- quantified by the [[Electric susceptibility]] and the [[Complex permittivity]]
- 
## How
- in the presence of an electric field, electrons are displaced slightly *towards* the electric field, and positive charges (usually holes) are displaced *away* from the electric field
- this displacement from the equilibrium generates an internal electric field that acts opposite to the applied electric field, counteracting its effect. 
	- reduces the magnitude of the net electric field within the dielectric itself
- 
## Why
- used in capacitors to store energy from an applied electric field (voltage) as energy, that can later be "released" via relaxation ([[debye relaxation]]) of the dipole moments in the dielectric.
