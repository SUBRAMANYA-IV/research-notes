#### Fermi Energy
- energy at which the probability of finding an electron is 50%
#### Fermi-Dirac
- Describes probability of an energy level being occupied
$$f(E)=\frac{1}{1+e^{(E-E_{F})/kT}}$$
	- at 0 K, stepwise function; all energy levels below $E_f$ are occupied, all levels above $E_f$ are empty
	- at higher temperatures, curve tends to sigmoid-function, higher probability of conduction-band levels being occupied by electrons
- Diagram shows fermi-dirac distribution along with charge-carrier densities
	- "deeper" into each region (conduction, valence), greater concentration of **available energy states**
