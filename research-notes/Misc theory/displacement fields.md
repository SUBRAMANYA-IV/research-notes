#### displacement fields
- given by 
$$
D=\frac{\epsilon V}{d}\vec{z}
$$
- which describes the displacement field generated *inside* a dielectric given its permittivity, the voltage applied (ie, back gate) and the thickness of the dielectric. 
	- apply potential difference across the back-gate
	- creates an electric field across the dielectric (recall, electric field is *potential difference per unit distance*)
	- dielectric polarizes in response to the electric field (permittivity)
	- resulting displacement field $D$ tells us how much "flux" or **induced charge density** is being transmitted towards the semiconductor channel.
