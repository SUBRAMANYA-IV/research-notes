### Photoconductive
- can be modeled as a resistor that changes conductivity depending on incident light
- bias voltage is applied: light increases carrier density, leading to an increase in current. 
- fast response (high speed detection)
- No internal electric field required; relies on **external bias**
### Photovoltaic 
- generates voltage or current without any applied bias
- built-in junction (ie, p-n) separates electron-hole pairs-> produces current. 
- slower response compared to PC in some cases but can generate power directly
