#### charge neutrality point
- condition where the total positive and negative charge *densities* in the system are equal
- fermi level is close to the intrinsic energy (mid-gap for semiconductors, **dirac-point for graphene**)
	- Conductivity reaches a minimum when the CMP is reached, via application of external biasing field.
