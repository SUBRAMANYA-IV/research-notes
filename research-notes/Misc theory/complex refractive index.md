## What
- ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the given medium 
	- real component describes the phase velocity, or rate of propogation of a traveling wave within a medium
	- complex component describes the [[extinction coefficient]], or the amount of *attenuation* when the electromagnetic wave propogtes through the material. Related to the absorption coefficient $\alpha_{abs}$ via 
	$$
	\alpha_{abs}(\omega)=\frac{2\omega \kappa(\omega)}{c}
	$$
	- note that the real and imaginary components of this refractive index are **not** independent, and are connected through the [[kramers-kronig]] relations
		- ie, the complex refractive index is a linear response function, ensuring causality
