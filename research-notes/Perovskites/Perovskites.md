## What
- crystalline material that follows the formula of $ABX_{3}$ with a crystal structure similar to that of the *mineral* perovskite, which consist of $CaTiO_{3}$. 
- $A$ and $B$ here are positively charged ions (anions), while $X$ is a negatively charged ion (anion). 
- below the [[curie temperature]], the cubic structure distorts slightly
	- positive cations are displaced relative to the negative anion, leading to a permanent [[dipole moment]] and spontaneous polarization 
	- spontaneous polarization can be **large**
## Why
- **High spontaneous polarization**
	- Enables strong ferroelectric, piezoelectric and pyroelectric effects useful in sensors, actuators, *lasers* and memory devices. 
- **temperature dependent dielectric properties**
	- large and tunable dielectric constants near the [[curie temperature]], allowing for capacitors and tunable devices
- **Strong coupling between structure and electric properties**
	- Ionic displacement directly affect polarization, enabling electric field control of material properties. 
- **Domain engineering**
	- Ability to manipulate domain structures with electric fields enhances device performance and functionality. 
- **Local Field Environment**
	- Unique local environment of ion in the perovskite lattice amplifies ferroelectric instability, making them response and efficient
- **Versatility in Composition**
	- Perovskite structures accommodates various cations, allowing tuning of properties for specific applications. 
- **Phase Transition Behavior**
	- Sharp phase transitions provide switching behavior essential in non-volatile ferroelectric memories.
