## What
- oscillating electric and/r magnetic field that does not *propagate* as an electromagnetic wave.
- in optics, evanescent waves are formed when the waves traveling in a medium undergo [[total internal reflection]] at its boundary because they strike at an angle greater than the [[critical angle]]. 
	- Recall that [[maxwell's equations]] dictate that electric and magnetic fields **cannot** be discontinuous at a boundary, analogous to the [[schrodinger wave-function]] in quantum mechanics for a confined-particle in a well
