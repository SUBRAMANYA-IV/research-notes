#### Background
- microscopy technique that uses electrons instead of light to obtain high resolution images and detailed surface information of samples
- in conventional microscopy, light is focused through a series of lenses, and the reflected light will encode or "contain" information about the actual sample, which is then magnified so that the user can view it
- in electron microscopy, electrons are focused using electro-magnets, and the reflected, diffracted electrons encode some information about the surface of the sample, which can then be collected/detected by a detector, yielding information about the surface of the sample. 

#### Theory
- The scanned beam strikes the sample, generating **multiple** signals including...
	- **Secondary electrons**: Low energy electrons ejected from the material's surface when a higher-energy beam (in this case, another electron) strikes it, transferring enough energy to knock out waekly bound atomic electrons (valence shell electrons). 
	- **Back scattered electrons**: **high energy** electrons from an incedent beam that scatter *backwards* (i.e, away from the samples surface/atoms). Gives compositional contrast in SEM (i.e, different elements/materials) due to heavier elements scattering **more**. Results from **elastic** interactions. Areas with denser materials leads to higher back scattering, hence show up as a "bright spot" on the resulting image. 
	- **Characteristic X-rays**: When an inner-shell electron is ejected via the primary beam, an outer shell electron drops down to fill this vacancy. this releases energy unique to each element in the form of a *photon(?)*, allowing for elemental identification and mapping.
