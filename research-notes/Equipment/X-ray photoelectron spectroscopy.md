## What
- **surface-sensitive** spectroscopic technique that identifies the **surface** material composition of a sample via the photoelectric effect. 
- measures the very topmost 50-60 atoms,or 5-10 nm of any surface. 
## How
- Given that the energy of an x-ray with a particular wavelength is known, and the emitted electron's kinetic energies are measured, the **electron binding energy** of each of the emitted electrons can be determined using the photoelectric effect equation, given by 

$$
E_{binding}=E_{photon}-(E_{kinetic}+\phi)
$$
- each element produces a set of characteristic XPS peaks, corresponding to the electron configuration of the electrons within the atoms, ie 1 s, 2 s, 2 p, 3 s...
- also capable of detecting chemical states and chemical shifts
	- ie, the local bonding environment of an atomic species from the topmost few nanometers of the sample
