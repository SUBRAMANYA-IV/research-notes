## What
- general methodology associated with changes in the direction of x-ray beams due to interactions with the electrons around an atom. 
- occurs due to elastic scattering, where there is **no change in the energy of the waves**

## How
- a model similar to a 3-d lasagna can be used to visualize the planes running through a crystalline structure

	- miller indices $h,k,l$ and inter-layer spacing given by $d$ yield the planes spanning the crystal structure. 
- incoming waves are scattered *specularly* (ie, mirror-like) from each plane. 
- most waves will destructively interfere... BUT when the angle $\theta$ between the plane and the x-ray results in a path-length difference that is an integer multiple $n$ of the X-ray wavelength $\lambda$, ie
$$
2d \sin(\theta)=n \lambda
$$
- this results in constructive interference, or a peak in the XRD measurement. 
- a reflection is said to be *indexed* when its miller indices (or rather, its basis vectors in the [[Reciprocal Lattice]]) have been identified for a known wavelength and scattering angle
- this indexing gives the **unit cell** parameters (related to the [[bravais lattice]]), as well as the [[space group]]
