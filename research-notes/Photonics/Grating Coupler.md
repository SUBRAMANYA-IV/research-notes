## What
- structure that allows one to couple light between an optical fiber and an on-chip wave-guide. 
## Why
- Integrated photonics utilizes sub-micron wave guides (ie, silicon 220 nm x 500 nm silicon cores), but external optical fibers have mode-diameters around 8-10 micrometers. 
## How
- consists of periodic etched grooves (diffraction grating) patterned on top of a wave guide region
- when light travels through the on-chip wave guide and hits the grating: 
	- each etched period scatters a small portion of the light **upward**
	- periodicity and etch depth are chosen so that constructive interference occurs in a specific direction; normally ~10 degrees from the normal 
	- creates a collimated beam that matches a fiber mode placed above it.
