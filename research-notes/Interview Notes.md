### What to Talk about
###### Why IMEC?
- similar to industrial research labs (BELL labs, xerox parc, etc)
- really cool work, developed molecular beam epitaxy, first transistor, etc

###### Why BP?
- already have background in sensors/fabrication
- really interested in sensor suits, signal processing, etc military hardware
	- mention reading up on the AIM-9 air to air missile, how it used a cooled lead sulfide detector with nitrogen cooling
- opens up new field of dynamically tunable sensors, really interesting applications and would love to see all the ways this could be used. 
	- curious how the anisotropic properties of BP can be used?
###### What I want
- More hands on experience working in a lab, collaberating with other people
- possibly some experience in DOE, methodology, solving problems
- maybe applying previous experience with FPGA's and microcontrollers for data collection, digital signal processing, A2D stuff, etc. 
- model work, refer to material charecteirzation framework. 

###### Future plans/fit
- ideally head back to grad school for a masters/PhD, continue working in the field
- get into any kind of R&D role: weather it be at IMEC, national labs, industry or otherwise.

### Black Phosphorous Properties
- thin film, 2-d material
- dynamic control of bandgap via back gate/top gate biasing
- single-few layer has strong-interlayer electric-state coupling
	- non-linear response to tuning, needs very strong external fields
	- band gap of ~2 eV
- bulk/many layer has weaker inter-layer coupling; field induced potential difference overcomes this. 
	- effective, continuous tuning of bandgap from 300 meV to 50 meV with external displacement field of 1.1 V/nm
	- band gap of ~0.3 eV
- fabricated via [[pulsed laser deposition]] 
	- pulsed laser deposition involves ablating bulk black phosphorous, which is then deposited on a substrate as red phosphorous 
	- converted back to black phosphorous via heating under high-pressure
- ... or or [[mechanical exfoliation]]
	- given that interlayer force is bound by weak forces (van-der walls), can be "lifted off" via adhesive
		- similar to pdms lift off process
### Lattice stuff
- **[[bravais lattice]]**
	- set of vectors that describe a crystal system
	- not to be confused with actual atoms
	- describes translational symmetry within a system
	- classified into 14 distinct groups (triciclic, cubic, orthogonal(?), etc)
		- actually combination of 7 rotational symmetries and 4 translational symmetries?
- **[[Reciprocal Lattice]]**
	- similar to bravais, but describes the crystal in frequency space, more specifically spatial frequency (wave number, k)
	- fourier space representation of bravais lattice
	- constructive interference or bragg's law occurs/is relavent to reciprocal lattice vectors. 
	- diffraction occurs when the wave-vector is part of the reciprocal lattice's basis. 
	- also describes band structure/bloch waves (need more research)
	- electron wave functions and densities are described by the reciprocal lattice (somehow)
### Black Phosphorous properties 
- “BP is unique because its layered, anisotropic, and puckered structure allows direct electrostatic control of its bandgap — enabling continuous tuning of optical absorption and carrier transport properties in a single device.”
### Electroluminescence 
- emission of photons via radiative recombination of electrons and holes in a material

### Photoluminescence
- light excites electron to conduction band from valence band, and return to valence band leads to emission of a photon of wavelength equivalent to the band gap
### Bandgap
- energy difference between valence and conduction band of a material
	- insulators have a very large bandgap; no real way to make them conduct
	- metals have no bandgap; valence and conduction overlap, charge carriers are free to move in normal state
	- semiconductors have small bandgaps; possible to excite/move charge carriers from valence to conduction band via various means (external electric field, temperature, etc)
- caused by smearing of band energies
	- band splitting, pauli exclusion principle, bonding/antibonding 
	- high density states close to the forbidden region for both conduction and valence band
