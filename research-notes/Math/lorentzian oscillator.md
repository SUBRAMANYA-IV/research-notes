## What
- model that assumes that the force binding an electron to the nucleus of an atom behaves according to Hooke's law, i.e a spring-like force. 
- applied electric field would interact with the charge of the electron, causing "stretching" and "compression", resulting in an oscillatory motion of the electron. 
	- External force is imparted via application of an electric field
	- damping/energy loss is due to inelastic collisions and *radiation due to acceleration of a charge*
