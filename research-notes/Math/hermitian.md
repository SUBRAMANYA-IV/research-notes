## What
- mathematical property that states that $$\text{an operator or function A is said to be hermitian if it equals its own complex transpose, ie }A ^{{\dagger}}$$
- In optics, relates to dealing with complex response functions (ie, complex dielectric functions)
## Why
- enforces "causality" in a system, ie  material's response cannot precede the applied electric field. 
- models like the [[forouhi-bloomer]] and [[brendel-bormann]] fail this causality, predicting the complex and real parts independently
- [[hermitian]] models give realistic, physical behavior while non-[[hermitian]] can yield un-physical dispersion or negative absorption
## How
- utilizes the [[kramers-kronig]] relation to create a bidirectional map between the real and complex parts of any complex function.
