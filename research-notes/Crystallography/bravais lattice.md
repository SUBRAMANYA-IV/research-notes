c- crystal lattices are classified by their **transnational** and **rotational** symmetry. 
- in 3-d, this yields a total of 14 *distinct* lattice types, which are called [[bravais lattice]]s
	- the dots represent lattice points, which are locations where the **whole structure repeats** by translation
		- **NOT** to be confused with location of actual atoms. This is described in the *basis* used
- Can be classified into 7 *crystal systems* or *crystal families*, which are defined by their **rotational** symmetry. 
- each of these can further be classified into **Transnational** symmetry, ie their lattice **centering**
	- Primitive (P): lattice points on the cell corners only
	- Body-Centered (I): lattice points on the cell corners with one additional point at the center of the cell
	- Face-Centered (F):  lattice points on all the cell corners with one additional point at the center of each of the *faces* of the cell
	- Base-Centered (A,B or C): lattice points on the cell corners with one additional point at the center of each face of one pair of parallel faces of the cell
- **NOTE**: not all combinations of the crystal systems and lattice centerings are unique. Theoretically there should be 6 * 7=42 combinations, but many of these are functionally equivalent, meaning there are only 14 *unique* combinations.
