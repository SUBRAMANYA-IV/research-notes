# Amorphous
- solid structure with a lack of repeating components
- when broken or cleaved, fragments are irregular, with often curved surfaces. 
- x-ray diffraction or other methods cant be used to characterize the material; no consistent diffraction/interference patterns. 
- **NOTE**: Amorphous does NOT imply it being anisotropic
# Crystalline
- solids with distinctive internal structures that lead to distinctive flat surfaces, or faces. 
- faces intersect at angles that are characteristic of the substance. 
- x-ray imaging methods can be used to classify/characterize the solid, yielding information about crystal orientation, inter-crystal spacing and more. 
-  **NOTE**: crystalline does NOT imply it being isotropic

# Isotropic
- a material is said to be isotropic if its physical properties such as refractive index, conductivity, dielectric constant, etc are the same in all directions.
- **mathematically, these properties can be described by a scalar instead of tensor/vector**
	- amorphous solids like amorphous Silicon or $\alpha Ge$ are Isotropic due to the atoms not having a long range order. 
	- no "preferred" orientation, averaging over all orientations yields the same properties. 
	- in **crystals**, isotropy only happens if the *crystals* symmetry is high enough (e.g, cubic structures). 

# Anisotropic
- a material is anisotropic if its properties *depend* on direction. ie, vary depending on crystallographic axis along which the measurement is being done. 
- **mathematically, has to be described as a tensor/vector**
	- examples include non-cubic crystals (hexagonal)
- Relates heavily to the [[miller-index]]
