- Recall that any electromagnetic wave abides by the property $f \lambda=c$
- The frequency does **not** change when a wave moves from one medium to another. 
- the wavelength **does** change when a wave moves from one medium to another, such that $\lambda_{m}=\frac{\lambda_{0}}{n}$, where $n$ is the refractive index of the new medium. 
- the wave vector, $k$, is an analog to the angular frequency, $\omega$, as it describes the spatial frequency of a wave. Given by
$$
\vec{k}=\frac{2\pi}{\vec{\lambda}}
$$
- The approximate expression for the change in frequency, $\Delta f$ with a change in wavelength, $\Delta \lambda$, we can expand the equation $f\lambda_{0}=c$ to
$$
\frac{df}{d \lambda}=\frac{d}{d\lambda}\left( \frac{c}{\lambda_{0}} \right)\implies -c \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda^2}
$$
#### Pre-lab Questions
$1.55 um$ wavelength
1) Optical frequency can be determined using $f \lambda=c$, hence $f=\frac{c}{\lambda}$, $f=\frac{3*10^8}{1.55*10^(-6)}=1.935810^14 Hz$
2) wave number is given by $k=\frac{2\pi n}{\lambda}$. Assuming its in a vacuum,$n=1$, hence $k=\frac{2\pi}{1.55*10^-6}=4053667.94$
3) Difference/change in frequency can be given by first finding the frequency of both waves, assuming both are traveling a vacuum. $f_{1}=\frac{3*10^8}{(1550*10^{-69})}, f_{2}=\frac{3*10^8}{1551*10^{-9}},\Delta f=f_{1}-f_{2}=721.251 kHz$
