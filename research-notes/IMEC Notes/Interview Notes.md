#### Perovskite Lasers
- normally uses metal halide perovskites. 
- high photoluminescence quantum yield (ratio of absorbed to emitted photons)
- low threshold, easy fabrication
- stability, ion migration, photobleaching 
#### Photonic crystal resonator 
- periodic index modulation -> photonic band gap
	- Refers to where the refractive index changes regularly, with respect to the crystal structure. 
	- Defects-> localized cavity mode
		- refers to confime electromagnetic fields in an optical cavity
		- intentionally introducing a missing section or rod introduces a cavity where light can resonate
	- High Q, low mode volume
		- light is tightly confined in a tiny space, forcing enhanced interactions. 
- Combining photonic crystal resonators with perovskite lasers provides...
	- Photonic crystal resonator: high feedback+ mode control 
	- perovskite provides strong gain
	- goal: low threshold, wavelength selecive, compact lasers. 
#### Optical characterization 
- Time resolved PL
	- Carrier life time, recombination dynamics
- Power-dependent PL
	- identify lasing theshold (kink in slope)
- Angle resolved PL
	- Mode structure, PhC dispersion 
- Spectral linewidth narrowing
	- lasing confirmation 
- Polarization-resolved measurements
	- cavity mode symmetry

#### Key terms 
- Q-factor: How efficiently a system (resonator) stores energy vs losing it, cavity loss/photon life time
- Mode volume: 
- Purcell effect: enhancement of emissions due to introducing a higher *density* of states, allowing excited electrons to enhance emissions
- Band edge
	- occur at boundaries of photonic band structure 
	- light slows down dramatically at band edges, increasing interaction time with any material
	- related to crystal periodicity 
- Defect modes
	- created by local disruptions
	- light becomes strongly confined and localized, leading to high quality factors (Q-factors) and small mode volumes
	- narrow resonances **within** the photonic band gap. 

#### Pitfalls 
- Moisture/oxygen sensitivity 
- Ion migration, leading to change in doping and performance/characteristics.
